<p>
After the system has installed a README file will be generated which contains passwords and some brief advice on using the installed systems. You can read this with the following commands:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">ssh username@domainname -p 2222
emacs ~/README
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You should transfer any passwords to a password manager such as <a href="http://www.keepassx.org/">KeepassX</a> and then delete them from the README file. To save the file after removing passwords use <b>CTRL-x CTRL-s</b>.
</p>

<p>
To exit you can either just close the terminal or use <b>CTRL-x CTRL-c</b> followed by the <b>exit</b> command.

<h2 id="orge45bf5b">Improving ssh security</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge45bf5b">
<p>
To improve ssh security you can generate an ssh key pair on your system and then upload the public key to the Freedombone.
</p>

<p>
On your local machine:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">ssh-keygen
</pre>
</div>

<p>
For extra security you may also want to add a passphrase to the ssh private key. You can show the generated public key with:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Log into your system and open the control panel.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">ssh username@domain -p 2222
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Select <i>Administrator controls</i> then <i>Manage Users</i> then <i>Change user ssh public key</i>. Copy and paste the public key here, then exit.
</p>

<p>
It's a good idea to also copy the contents of <b>~/.ssh/id_rsa</b> and <b>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</b> to you password manager, together with the private key password if you created one.
</p>

<p>
There are advantages and disadvantages to using ssh keys for logins. The advantage is that this is much more secure than a memorised password, but the disadvantage is that you need to carry your ssh keys around and be able to install them on any computer of mobile device that you use. In high security or hostile infosec environments it may not be possible to carry or use USB thumb drives containing your keys and so memorised passwords may be the only available choice.
</p>

<p>
If you wish to only use ssh keys then log in to the Freedombone, become the root user and open the control panel with the 'control' command. Select <i>Security Settings</i> then keep hitting enter until you reach the question about allowing password logins. Select "no" for that, then apply the settings. Any subsequent attempts to log in via a password will then be denied.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbfd590b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbfd590b">Administrating the system via an onion address (Tor)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbfd590b">
<p>
You can also access your system via the Tor system using an onion address. To find out what the onion address for ssh access is you can do the following:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">ssh username@freedombone.local -p 2222
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Select <i>Administrator controls</i> then select "About this system" and look for the onion address for ssh. You can then close the terminal and open another, then do the following on your local system:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">freedombone-client
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This will set up your ssh environment to be able to handle onion addresses. In addition if you use monkeysphere then you can do:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">freedombone-client --ms yes
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then you can test ssh with:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">ssh username@address.onion -p 2222
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Subsequently even if dynamic DNS isn't working you may still be able to administer your system. Using the onion address also gives you some degree of protection against corporate or government metadata analysis, since it becomes more difficult to passively detect which systems are communicating.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgace58c4">
<p>
<a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a> provides a similar capability to proprietary systems such as <a href="http://www.drop-dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, and also is well suited for use with low power single board computers. You can have one or more directories which are synchronized across your various laptops/desktops/devices, and this makes it hard for you to ever lose important files. The manner in which the synchronization is done is pretty secure, such that it would be difficult for passive adversaries (mass surveillance, "<i>men in the middle</i>", etc) to know what files you're sharing. Of course, you don't necessarily need to be running a server in order to use Syncthing, but if you do have a server which is always running then there's always at least one place to synchronize your files to or from.
</p>

<p>
Freedombone provides Syncthing shared directories for each user on the system, plus a single shared directory for all users. The expected most common scenario here is that of a family in which members may not want to share <i>all of their files</i> with each other, but might want to share some in a common pool (eg. birthday photos). You can also easily share between different servers.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org972f0d4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org972f0d4">On a laptop</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org972f0d4">
<p>
Install syncthing:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">curl -s https://syncthing.net/release-key.txt | sudo apt-key add -
<span class="org-builtin">echo</span> <span class="org-string">"deb http://apt.syncthing.net/ syncthing release"</span> | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/syncthing.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install syncthing
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Add syncthing to your startup applications, so that it begins running when your system starts. Then either restart your system or run the command "syncthing" from a terminal.
</p>

<p>
In another terminal log into Freedombone:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">ssh username@domainname -p 2222
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then select <b>File Synchronization</b>.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="images/controlpanel/control_panel_file_sync.jpg" alt="control_panel_file_sync.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Select <b>Show device ID</b> and copy the long string of letters and numbers shown, using the shift key then select the text followed by right click then select copy.
</p>

<p>
Open a non-Tor browser and enter  <b><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8384/">http://127.0.0.1:8384/</a></b> as the URL. You should now see the minimalistic user interface. Under <b>Remote Devices</b> select <b>Add Remote Device</b>. In the <b>Device ID</b> field paste the string you just copied (CTRL+v). The Device name can be anything. Under <b>Share Folders with Device</b> check <b>default</b> (or whatever folder you created on your local machine), then save.
</p>

<p>
From the top menu select <b>Actions</b> and then <b>Show ID</b>, then copy the ID string (usually select then CTRL+c). Go back to the terminal control panel menu and select <b>Add an ID</b> then paste what you just copied (CTRL+v). Optionally you can also provide a description so that you later can know what that string corresponds to.
</p>

<p>
Now wait for a few minutes. Eventually you will see two messages appear within the browser asking if you want to add two new folders from the Freedombone server. Say yes to both, and specify <b>~/Sync</b> as the directory with your username and <b>~/SyncShared</b> as the shared directory. You can now copy files into your <b>~/Sync</b> directory and they will automatically be synced to the server. Those will be files which only you can access. If you copy files into <b>~/SyncShared</b> then they will also be available to any other users on the system.

Install Syncthing and Connectbot from F-droid.

<p>
Set up Connectbot to log into Freedombone.
</p>

<p>
Select <b>File Synchronization</b>.
</p>

<p>
Select <b>Show device ID</b> and copy the long string of letters by pressing anywhere on the screen, selecting the <b>menu</b> then <b>copy</b> and then selecting the ID string. This is very tricky on a small screen, so expect to fail multiple times before you succeed in copying the text.
</p>

<p>
Open Syncthing and select the devices tab. Press on <b>+</b> and then paste the device ID with a long press followed by <b>Paste</b>. You may need to remove any stray characters which were copied during the previous haphazard selection process. Add a name, which can be anything.
</p>

<p>
Now select the menu (top left or menu button) and then press on <b>Device ID</b>. It will be copied to the clipboard. Go back to Connectbot and from the control panel select <b>File Synchronization</b> followed by <b>Add an ID</b>. You can then paste in the ID with a long press, and optionally add a description for the device. When that's done you can disconnect from Connectbot.
</p>

<p>
Now wait for a few minutes or more. Eventually you should receive two notifications (swipe down from the top to see them) which will allow you to confirm the connection to the server. Say yes to both, and specify appropriate directories for your files and the shared files. To reduce battery and data usage via the settings you can also set Syncthing to only sync while it's charging and only while it's connected to wifi.

<h3 id="orgdf01119">With the DLNA service</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdf01119">
<p>
An easy way to play music on any mobile device in your home is to use the DLNA service. Copy your music into a directory called "<i>Music</i>" on a USB thumb drive and then insert it into from socket on the Beaglebone.
</p>

<p>
ssh into the system with:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">ssh myusername@mydomain.com -p 2222
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then mount the USB drive with:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">su
attach-music
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The system will scan the Music directory, which could take a while if there are thousands of files, but you don't need to do anything further with the Beaglebone other than perhaps to log out by typing <b>exit</b> a couple of times.
</p>

<p>
If you have an Android device then go to F-Droid (if you don't already have it installed then it can be <a href="https://f-droid.org/">downloaded here</a>) and search for <b>ControlDLNA</b>. On running the app you should see a red Debian icon which you can press on, then you may need to select "local". After a few seconds the list of albums or tracks should then appear and you can browse and play them.
</p>

<p>
The DLNA service will only work within your local home network, and isn't remotely accessible from other locations via the internet. That can be both a good and a bad thing. Another consideration is that there are no access controls on DLNA services, so any music or videos on the USB drive will be playable by anyone within your home network.

Both Hubzilla and GNU Social try to obtain certificates automatically at the time of installation via Let's Encrypt.

<p>
Then select <b>IRC</b> from the menu. However, other than via this method using ssh, irssi isn't a very good IRC client because it doesn't have the capability to onion route messages, and therefore leaks metadata.

<p>
The <a href="http://profanity.im/">Profanity</a> shell based user interface and is perhaps the simplest way to use XMPP from a laptop. It's also a good way to ensure that your OTR keys are the same even when logging in from different laptops or devices, and it also means that if those devices later become compomised then there are no locally stored OTR keys to be found.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">ssh username@domain -p 2222
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then select XMPP. Generate an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging">OTR</a> key with:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">/otr gen
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then to start a conversation using OTR:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">/otr start otherusername@otheruserdomain
</pre>
</div>

<p>
or if you're already in an insecure chat with someone just use:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">/otr start
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Set a security question and answer:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">/otr question <span class="org-string">"What is the name of your best friends rabbit?"</span> fiffi
</pre>
</div>

<p>
On the other side the user can enter:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">/otr answer fiffi
</pre>
</div>

<p>
For the most paranoid you can also obtain your fingerprint:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">/otr myfp
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and quote that.  If they quote theirs back you can check it with:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">/otr theirfp
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If the fingerprints match then you can be pretty confident that unless you have been socially engineered via the question and answer you probably are talking to who you think you are, and that it will be difficult for mass surveillance systems to know the content of the conversation. For more details see <a href="http://www.profanity.im/otr.html">this guide</a>.
</p>

<p>
When accessed via the user control panel the client is automatically routed through Tor and so if you are also using OTR then this provides protection for both message content and metadata.

<h4 id="org5cbcb15">Using with Jitsi</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5cbcb15">
<p>
Jitsi is the recommended communications client for desktop or laptop systems, since it includes the <i>off the record</i> (OTR) feature which provides some additional security beyond the usual SSL certificates.
</p>

<p>
Jitsi can be downloaded from <a href="https://jitsi.org/">https://jitsi.org/</a>
</p>

<p>
On your desktop/laptop open Jitsi and select <b>Options</b> from the <b>Tools</b> menu.
</p>

<p>
Click <b>Add</b> to add a new user, then enter the Jabber ID which you previously specified with <i>prosodyctl</i> when setting up the XMPP server. Close and then you should notice that your status is "Online" (or if not then you should be able to set it to online).
</p>

<p>
From the <b>File</b> menu you can add contacts, then select the chat icon to begin a chat.  Click on the lock icon on the right hand side and this will initiate an authentication procedure in which you can specify a question and answer to verify the identity of the person you're communicating with.  Once authentication is complete then you'll be chating using OTR, which provides an additional layer of security.
</p>

<p>
When opening Jitsi initially you will get a certificate warning for your domain name (assuming that you're using a self-signed certificate). If this happens then select <b>View Certificate</b> and enable the checkbox to trust the certificate, then select <b>Continue Anyway</b>.  Once you've done this then the certificate warning will not appear again unless you reinstall Jitsi or use a different computer.
</p>

<p>
You can also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgx7VSrDGjk">see this video</a> as an example of using OTR.

The default XMPP client in Ubuntu is Empathy.  Using Empathy isn't as secure as using Jitsi, since it doesn't include the <i>off the record</i> feature, but since it's the default it's what many users will have easy access to.
</p>

<p>
Open <b>System Settings</b> and select <b>Online Accounts</b>, <b>Add account</b>  and then <b>Jabber</b>.
</p>

<p>
Enter your username (username@domainname) and password.
</p>

<p>
Click on <b>Advanced</b> and make sure that <b>Encryption required</b> and <b>Ignore SSL certificate errors</b> are checked.

When the initial cryptographic negotiation between phones is done at the start of a call a short authentication string (SAS) is calculated and displayed at both ends. To check that there isn't anyone intercepting the call and acting as a <i>man in the middle</i> - as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stingray_phone_tracker">stingray type devices</a> try to do - the short authentication string can be read out and verbally confirmed between the callers.

<h2 id="org5bc9649">RSS Reader</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5bc9649">
<p>
The way that RSS reading is set up on Freedombone gives you strong reading privacy. Not only is there onion routing between you and the server but also between the server and the source of the RSS feed. The only down side is that many RSS feeds are still http only, and so could be vulnerable to injection attacks, but it's expected that more of this will go to https in the foreseeable future due to a combination of growing recognition of security issues and systems like Let's Encrypt which make obtaining certificates much easier.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="images/rss_reader_mobile.jpg" alt="rss_reader_mobile.jpg" />

<p>
See the control panel for the RSS reader onion address.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">ssh username@domainname -p 2222
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Select <i>Administrator controls</i> then select the <b>About</b> screen.
</p>

<p>
The RSS reader is accessible only via an onion address. This provides a reasonable degree of reading privacy, making it difficult for passive adversaries such as governments, corporations or criminals to create lists of sites which you are subscribed to.
</p>

<p>
To set up the system open <a href="http://rss_reader_onion_address/">http://rss_reader_onion_address/</a> and log in with username <b>admin</b> and the password obtained either at the beginning of the install or from the README file in your home directory. You can then select the <b>Actions</b> menu and begin adding your feeds.
</p>

<p>
To access the RSS reader from a mobile device you can install a Tor compatible browser such as Orbot+OrWeb. It will try to automatically change to the mobile version of the user interface. Remember to add the site to the NoScript whitelist, and you may also need to turn HTTPS Everywhere off.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A note for the paranoid is that on mobile devices you get redirected to a different onion address which is specially set up for the mobile interface, so don't be alarmed that it looks like your connection is being hijacked.
