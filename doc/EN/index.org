So you want to run your own internet services? Email, chat, VoIP, web sites, file synchronisation, wikis, blogs, social networks, backups. Freedombone enables you to do all of that in a self-hosted way, where you keep control of your data and it resides in your own home.

Want to make a community mesh network which doesn't depend upon the internet? You can do that too.

But how?
