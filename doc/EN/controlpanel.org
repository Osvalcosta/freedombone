* Main menu
You can access the main menu by logging into the system, then running the *control* command with root privileges.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ssh myusername@mydomain -p 2222
sudo control
#+END_SRC

It should look like this:

#+BEGIN_CENTER

#+END_CENTER

To select anythng on the control panel use the *up and down* cursor keys and *space bar* to tag, then press *Enter*.

* About screen
To find out your current domain names select the About screen from the main menu. This is especially useful for finding your onion addresses. For improved security by compartmentalisation, and also simpler implementation, each application has its own onion address.

You can also see the SIP extension numbers for each user and how much disk space each user is consuming (typically this corresponds with email use).

The Local Mirrors contains mirrored copies of the git repositories used by the system. If they don't have access to default repositories (mostly Github) then you can give these details to other users and then they can set their main repository such that they can pull from your system. Obviously any users doing this need to trust that you havn't modified the mirrored repositories in any way.

* Email filtering rules
You can add users to mailing lists, or block particular email addresses or subject lines in this menu.

* Hubzilla menu
This allows you to set the global directory location and obtain an SSL/TLS certificate if necessary.

#+END_CENTER

* IRC menu
You can set a password for your IRC server here.

#+BEGIN_CENTER

#+END_CENTER

* Media menu
It's possible to add playable media to a USB drive and plug it into the system, then make it accessible to other devices such as tablets or phones on your local network via DLNA.

#+BEGIN_CENTER

#+END_CENTER

* Repository mirrors
If you don't want to use the default repositories, or don't have access to them, then you can obtain them from another Freedombone server (the details can be found on the other server on the *About* screen of the control panel).

#+BEGIN_CENTER
[[file:images/controlpanel/control_panel_mirrors.jpg]]
#+END_CENTER

* Backup and restore menu
You can create backups or restore from backup here. It's also possible to create keydrives which store the backup key.

#+BEGIN_CENTER

#+END_CENTER

* Security menu
If you need to generate SSL/TLS certificates or change cypher details due to changing recommendations then you can do that here. If you are changing cypher details be extra careful not to make mistakes/typos, which could reduce the security of your system.
